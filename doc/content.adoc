== Introduction

_beicon_ is a small and concise library that provides reactive streams api for
clojure and clojurescript.

[WARNING]
====
This documentation does not covers all api, so if you miss
some function, contributions are very welcome. You can see the full
link:api/index.html#id[API documentation here].
====


=== Project Maturity

Since _beicon_ is a young project there can be some API breakage.


=== Install

The simplest way to use _beicon_ in a clojure project, is by including it in the
dependency vector on your *_project.clj_* file:

[source,clojure]
----
[funcool/beicon "3.5.0"]
----


== Creating Streams

This section will give you the available methods for create observable streams.


=== From a collection

The most basic way to create a stream is just take a collection
and convert it in an observable sequence:

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[beicon.core :as rx])

(def stream (rx/from-coll [1 2 3]))

(rx/on-value stream #(println "v:" %))
;; ==> v: 1
;; ==> v: 2
;; ==> v: 3
----


=== From range

An other way to create an observable stream is using the `range` constructor
that is pretty analogous to the clojure's one:

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (rx/range 3))

(rx/on-value stream #(println "v:" %))
;; ==> v: 0
;; ==> v: 1
;; ==> v: 2
----


=== From Atom

Atoms in clojure are watchable, so you can listen its changes. This method convert
that changes in an infinite observable sequence of atom changes:

[source, clojure]
----
(def a (atom 1))

(def stream (rx/from-atom a))

(rx/on-value stream #(println "v:" %))
(swap! a inc)
;; ==> v: 2
----


=== From Value

It creates an observable sequence of one unique value:

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (rx/just 10)

(rx/on-value stream #(println "v:" %))
;; ==> v: 10
----

NOTE: `just` or `once` are simple aliases to `of` function.


=== From multiple values

It there is a way for create an observable seequence from
multiple values, using the `of` consturctor:

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (rx/of 1 2 3))

(rx/on-value stream #(println "v:" %))
;; ==> v: 1
;; ==> v: 2
;; ==> v: 3
----


=== Empty

Some times you also want just a terminated stream:

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (rx/empty))
----

This stream not yelds any value and just terminates.


=== With timeout

This allow create an observable seequence of one unique value that will be emited
after specified amount of time:

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (rx/timeout 1000 10))

(rx/on-value stream #(println "v:" %))
;; After 1 sec...
;; ==> v: 10
----


=== From factory

This is the most advanced and flexible way to create an observable sequence. It
allows to have control about termination and errors and intended to be used
for build other kinds of constructors.

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream
  (rx/create (fn [sink]
               (sink 1)          ;; next with `1` as value
               (sink (rx/end 2)) ;; next with `2` as value and end the stream
               (fn []
                 ;; function called on unsubscription
                 ))))

(rx/on-value stream #(println "v:" %))
;; ==> v: 1
;; ==> v: 2
----

This is implemented using protocols for make it flexible and easy extensible
by the user. This is how the default impl behaves:

- Exceptions or exception instances triggers the error termination of stream.
- `(rx/end value)` sends the unwrapped value to the stream, then terminate stream.
- `rx/end` as value triggers the stream termination.
- `nil` triggers stream validation.
- any other value are valid values for send to the stream.

On the JVM, there are other factory method that allow create backpressure-aware
observables:

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream
  (rx/generate (fn [state sink]
                 (let [nextval (inc state)]
                   (sink nextval)
                   nextval))
               (constantly 0)))
----

The difference with the `create` function, the `generate` executes the
factory function multiple and you need to call sink *once* for each
execution. Additionally, you can maintain state between executions
retuning the desired value, that value will passed as first argument
on the next execution. You can provide an initial state using the
second argument and dispose callback as third argument.

Many simple observables can be converted to be backpressure-aware using
the `to-flowable` function. Take cara that there are no magic, the buffering
strategy is used by default for handle backpressure (over production).

[source, clojure]
----
(->> (rx/from-coll [1 2 3])
     (rx/to-flowable))
----

Optionally, you can specify the strategy to use for handle backpressure
using the first argument:

[source, clojure]
----
(->> (rx/from-coll [1 2 3])
     (rx/to-flowable :error))
----

This is a list of available strategies:

- `:buffer` - Buffers all values until the downstream consumes it.
- `:error` - Signals a `MissingBackpressureException` in case the downstream can't keep up.
- `:drop` - Drops the most recent value if the downstream can't keep up.
- `:latest` - Keeps only the latest value, overwriting any previous value if the downstream can't keep up.


== Consuming streams

=== The stream states

The observable sequence can be in 3 different kind of states: alive, errored or
ended. I an error is emited the stream can be considered ended with an error.
So error or end states can be considered termination states.

And is convenient you can subscribe to any of that states of an observable
sequence.


=== General purpose

A general purpose subscription is one that allows you create one subscription
that watches all the different possible states of an observable sequence:

[source, clojure]
----
(def sub (rx/subscribe stream
                       #(println "on-value:" %)
                       #(println "on-error:" %)
                       #(println "on-end:")))
----

The return value of `subscribe` function is a subscription object that identifies
the current subscription. It can be cancelled executing `(rx/cancel! sub)`.


=== Consume values

But in most circumstances you only want consume values regardless of any error
or termination. For this purposes is there the `on-value` function:

[source, clojure]
----
(def sub (rx/on-value sub #(println "val:" %)))
----

Like with `subscribe` function, `on-value` function also return a callable that
when is called will dispose the created subscription.

NOTE: take care that calling any one of that helper functions creates a
separated subscription and it can behave unexpectly if you do not aware if you
are using <<hot or cold observables, hot-vs-cold-observales>>.


=== Consume successful termination

With `on-end` function you can watch the successful termination of an observable
sequence:

[source, clojure]
----
(def sub (rx/on-end sub #(println "end!")))
----


=== Consume error termination

With `on-error` function you can watch the error termination of an observable
sequence:

[source, clojure]
----
(def sub (rx/on-end sub #(println "error:" %)))
----


=== Backpressure-aware consimption

The streams created using the `generate` function, are backpressure-aware
streams and can be consumed in backpressure-aware way. For this you need to pass
object that implements the `ISubscriber` protocol. Let see an example:

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream
  (->> (rx/from-coll [1 2 3])
       (rx/to-flowable :buffer)))

(rx/subscribe-with stream (reify rx/ISubscriber
                            (-on-init [_ s]
                              (s/request! s 1))

                            (-on-next [_ s v]
                              (println "on-next:" v)
                              (s/request! s 1))

                            (-on-error [_ e]
                              (println "on-error"))

                            (-on-end [_]
                              (println "on-end"))))
;; => on-next: 1
;; => on-next: 2
;; => on-next: 3
;; => on-end
----

In the same way as `subscribe` function, the `subscribe-with` returns
a cancellable subscription object.


== Transformations

=== Filter

The main advantage of using reactive streams is that you may treat them like
normal sequence, and in this case filter them with a predicate:

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (->> (rx/from-coll [1 2 3 4 5])
                 (rx/filter #(> % 3))))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: 4
;; ==> on-value: 5
;; ==> on-end
----


=== Map

Also, you can apply a function over each value in the stream:

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (->> (rx/from-coll [1 2])
                 (rx/map inc)))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: 2
;; ==> on-value: 3
;; ==> on-end
----


=== Flat Map

Convets an observable sequence that can contain other observable sequences in
an other observable sequences that emits just plain values.

The result is similar to concatenate all the underlying sequences.

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (->> (rx/from-coll [1 2])
                 (rx/map #(sfrom-coll (range % (+ % 2))))
                 (rx/flat-map))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: 1
;; ==> on-value: 2
;; ==> on-value: 2
;; ==> on-value: 3
;; ==> on-end
----


=== Skip

Also, sometimes you just want to skip values from stream under different criteria.

You can skip the first N values:

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (->> (rx/from-coll [1 2 3 4 5 6])
                 (rx/skip 4)))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: 5
;; ==> on-value: 6
;; ==> on-end
----

Skip while some condition evalutates to true:

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (->> (rx/from-coll [1 1 1 1 2 3])
                 (rx/skip-while odd?)))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: 2
;; ==> on-value: 3
;; ==> on-end
----

Or skip until an other observable yelds a value using `skip-until` (no example at
this moment).


=== Take

You also can limit the observale sequence to an specified number of elements:

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (->> (rx/from-coll [1 1 1 1 2 3])
                 (rx/take 2)))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: 1
;; ==> on-value: 1
;; ==> on-end
----

Or an condition expression evaluates to true:

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (->> (rx/from-coll [1 1 1 1 2 3])
                 (rx/take-while odd?)))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: 1
;; ==> on-value: 1
;; ==> on-value: 1
;; ==> on-value: 1
;; ==> on-end
----


=== Slice

This is a some kind of combination of `skip` and `take`, and returns an observable
sequence that represents a portion delimited by start and end of the source
observable sequence.

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (->> (rx/from-coll [1 2 3 4])
                 (rx/slice 1 3)))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: 2
;; ==> on-value: 3
;; ==> on-end
----


=== Reduce

Allows combine all results of an observable sequence using a combining function
also called (reducing function):

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (->> (rx/from-coll [1 2 3 4])
                 (rx/reduce + 0)))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: 10
;; ==> on-end
----

=== Scan

Allows combine all results of an observable sequence using a combining function
also called (reducing function). Returns a stream of each intermediate result
instead of:

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (->> (rx/from-coll [1 2 3 4])
                 (rx/scan + 0)))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: 1
;; ==> on-value: 3
;; ==> on-value: 6
;; ==> on-value: 10
;; ==> on-end
----


=== Buffer

This transformer functions allow accomulate N specified values in a buffer and then
emits them as one value.

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (->> (rx/from-coll [1 2 3 4])
                 (rx/buffer 2)))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: [1 2]
;; ==> on-value: [3 4]
;; ==> on-end
----


== Combinators

=== Choice

Perform an arbitrary choice between two or more observable sequences and return the
first value available from any provided observables.

This kind if combinator works very well with operations that can timeout:

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (rx/choice
              (rx/timeout 1000 :timeout)
              (rx/timeout 900 :value)))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: :value
;; ==> on-end
----


=== Zip

This combinator combines two observable sequences in one.

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (rx/zip
              (rx/from-coll [1 2 3])
              (rx/from-coll [2 3 4])))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: [1 2]
;; ==> on-value: [2 3]
;; ==> on-value: [3 4]
;; ==> on-end
----


=== Concat

This cobinator concatenates two or more observable sequences.

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (rx/concat
              (rx/from-coll [1 2])
              (rx/from-coll [3 4])))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: 1
;; ==> on-value: 2
;; ==> on-value: 3
;; ==> on-value: 4
;; ==> on-end
----


=== Merge

This combinator merges two or more observable sequences.

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (rx/concat
              (rx/from-coll [1 2])
              (rx/from-coll [3 4])))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: 1
;; ==> on-value: 3
;; ==> on-value: 2
;; ==> on-value: 4
;; ==> on-end
----

NOTE: the order is not required to be the same always.


== Subject

This is an abstraction that combines observable sequence with the observer. So
you can push values into it and transform and subscribe to it like any other
sequence.

=== Creating a subject.

You can create a subject instance using `subject` constructor function. There is an
example of using subject for the both operations: push values and subscribe to it.

[source, clojure]
----
(def subject (rx/subject))
(def stream (->> subject
                (rx/skip 1)
                (rx/map inc)
                (rx/take 2)))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

(rx/push! subject 1)
(rx/push! subject 2)
(rx/push! subject 1)
(rx/push! subject 2)

;; ==> on-value: 3
;; ==> on-value: 2
;; ==> on-end
----


=== Ending a subject

You can end subject in any moment just executing `end!` function:

[source, clojure]
----
(def subject (rx/subject))

(rx/subscribe subject
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

(rx/end! subject)
;; ==> on-end
----


== Developers Guide

=== Philosophy

Five most important rules:

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Readability counts.

All contributions to _beicon_ should keep these important rules in mind.
