== Introduction

_beicon_ is a small and concise library that provides reactive streams API for
Clojure and ClojureScript.

[WARNING]
====
This documentation does not cover the whole API, so if you miss
some function, contributions are very welcome. You can see the full
link:api/index.html#id[API documentation here].
====


=== Project Maturity

Since _beicon_ is a young project there can be some API breakage.


=== Install

The simplest way to use _beicon_ in a Clojure project, is by including it in the
dependency vector on your *_project.clj_* file:

[source,clojure]
----
[funcool/beicon "4.0.0"]
----


== Creating Streams

This section will give you the available methods for create observable streams.


=== From a collection

The most basic way to create a stream is to just take a collection
and convert it into an observable sequence:

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[beicon.core :as rx])

(def stream (rx/from-coll [1 2 3]))

(rx/on-value stream #(println "v:" %))
;; ==> v: 1
;; ==> v: 2
;; ==> v: 3
----


=== From range

An other way to create an observable stream is using the `range` constructor,
which is pretty analogous to the Clojures one:

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (rx/range 3))

(rx/on-value stream #(println "v:" %))
;; ==> v: 0
;; ==> v: 1
;; ==> v: 2
----


=== From Atom

Atoms in Clojure are watchable, so you can listen for their changes. This method converts
that changes into an infinite observable sequence of atom changes:

[source, clojure]
----
(def a (atom 1))

(def stream (rx/from-atom a))

(rx/on-value stream #(println "v:" %))
(swap! a inc)
;; ==> v: 2
----


=== From Value

It creates an observable sequence of one unique value:

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (rx/just 10)

(rx/on-value stream #(println "v:" %))
;; ==> v: 10
----

NOTE: `just` or `once` are simple aliases to `of` function.


=== From multiple values

There is a way to create an observable sequence from
multiple values, using the `of` constructor:

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (rx/of 1 2 3))

(rx/on-value stream #(println "v:" %))
;; ==> v: 1
;; ==> v: 2
;; ==> v: 3
----


=== Empty

Some times you also want just a terminated stream:

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (rx/empty))
----

This stream does not yield any value and just terminates.


=== With timeout

This allows to create an observable sequence of one unique value, that will be emitted
after a specified amount of time:

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (rx/timeout 1000 10))

(rx/on-value stream #(println "v:" %))
;; After 1 sec...
;; ==> v: 10
----


=== From factory

This is the most advanced and flexible way to create an observable sequence. It
allows to have control about termination and errors, and is intended to be used
for building other kinds of constructors.

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream
  (rx/create (fn [sink]
               (sink 1)          ;; next with `1` as value
               (sink (rx/end 2)) ;; next with `2` as value and end the stream
               (fn []
                 ;; function called on unsubscription
                 ))))

(rx/on-value stream #(println "v:" %))
;; ==> v: 1
;; ==> v: 2
----

This is implemented using protocols to make it flexible and easily extensible
by the user. This is how the default implementation behaves:

- Exceptions or exception instances trigger the error termination of stream.
- `(rx/end value)` sends the unwrapped value to the stream, then terminates stream.
- `rx/end` as value triggers the stream termination.
- `nil` triggers stream validation.
- any other values are valid values for sending to the stream.

On the JVM, there are other factory methods, that allow creation of backpressure-aware
observables:

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream
  (rx/generate (fn [state sink]
                 (let [nextval (inc state)]
                   (sink nextval)
                   nextval))
               (constantly 0)))
----

The difference to the `create` function, the `generate` executes the
factory function multiple times and you need to call sink *once* for each
execution. Additionally, you can maintain state between executions
retuning the desired value and that value will passed as first argument
on the next execution. You can optionally provide an initial state using the
second argument `setup` and a third `dispose` callback.

Many simple observables can be converted to be backpressure-aware using
the `to-flowable` function. Be aware, that the default strategy `:buffer` (see below)
is used by default to handle backpressure (over production).

[source, clojure]
----
(->> (rx/from-coll [1 2 3])
     (rx/to-flowable))
----

Optionally, you can specify the strategy to use for handling backpressure
by the first argument:

[source, clojure]
----
(->> (rx/from-coll [1 2 3])
     (rx/to-flowable :error))
----

This is a list of available strategies:

- `:buffer` - Buffers all values until the downstream consumes it.
- `:error` - Signals a `MissingBackpressureException` in case the downstream can't keep up.
- `:drop` - Drops the most recent value, if the downstream can't keep up.
- `:latest` - Keeps only the latest value, overwriting any previous value, if the downstream can't keep up.


== Consuming streams

=== The stream states

The observable sequence can be in three different kind of states: *alive*, *"errored"* or
*ended*. If an error is emitted the stream can be considered ended with an error.
So *error* or *end* states are considered termination states.

And for convenience you can subscribe to any of that states of an observable
sequence.


=== General purpose

A general purpose subscription is one that allows you to create one subscription,
that watches all the different possible states of an observable sequence:

[source, clojure]
----
(def sub (rx/subscribe stream
                       #(println "on-value:" %)
                       #(println "on-error:" %)
                       #(println "on-end:")))
----

The return value of the `subscribe` function is a subscription object, that identifies
the current subscription. It can be cancelled by executing `(rx/cancel! sub)`.


=== Consume values

But in most circumstances you only want to consume values regardless of any error
or termination. For this purposes there is the `on-value` function:

[source, clojure]
----
(def sub (rx/on-value sub #(println "val:" %)))
----

Like with the `subscribe` function, the `on-value` function also returns a callable, that,
when called, will dispose the created subscription.

NOTE: take care, that calling any one of those helper functions creates a
separated subscription and it can behave unexpectedly, if you are not aware whether you
are using <<hot or cold observables, hot-vs-cold-observales>>.


=== Consume successful termination

With the `on-end` function you can watch the successful termination of an observable
sequence:

[source, clojure]
----
(def sub (rx/on-end sub #(println "end!")))
----


=== Consume error termination

With the `on-error` function you can watch the error termination of an observable
sequence:

[source, clojure]
----
(def sub (rx/on-end sub #(println "error:" %)))
----


=== Backpressure-aware consimption

The streams created using the `generate` function, are backpressure-aware
streams and can be consumed in an backpressure-aware way. For this you need to pass
an object, that implements the `ISubscriber` protocol. Lets see an example:

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream
  (->> (rx/from-coll [1 2 3])
       (rx/to-flowable :buffer)))

(rx/subscribe-with stream (reify rx/ISubscriber
                            (-on-init [_ s]
                              (s/request! s 1))

                            (-on-next [_ s v]
                              (println "on-next:" v)
                              (s/request! s 1))

                            (-on-error [_ e]
                              (println "on-error"))

                            (-on-end [_]
                              (println "on-end"))))
;; => on-next: 1
;; => on-next: 2
;; => on-next: 3
;; => on-end
----

In the same way as the `subscribe` function, the `subscribe-with` returns
a cancellable subscription object.


== Transformations

=== Filter

The main advantage of using reactive streams is that you may treat them like
normal sequences, and in this case filter them with a predicate:

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (->> (rx/from-coll [1 2 3 4 5])
                 (rx/filter #(> % 3))))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: 4
;; ==> on-value: 5
;; ==> on-end
----


=== Map

Also, you can apply a function over each value in the stream:

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (->> (rx/from-coll [1 2])
                 (rx/map inc)))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: 2
;; ==> on-value: 3
;; ==> on-end
----


=== Flat Map

Converts an observable sequence, that can contain other observable sequences, into a
new observable sequence, that emits just plain values.

The result is similar to concatenating all the underlying sequences.

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (->> (rx/from-coll [1 2])
                 (rx/map #(sfrom-coll (range % (+ % 2))))
                 (rx/flat-map))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: 1
;; ==> on-value: 2
;; ==> on-value: 2
;; ==> on-value: 3
;; ==> on-end
----


=== Skip

Also, sometimes you just want to skip values from stream by different criteria.

You can skip the first N values:

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (->> (rx/from-coll [1 2 3 4 5 6])
                 (rx/skip 4)))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: 5
;; ==> on-value: 6
;; ==> on-end
----

Skip while some predicate evaluates to `true`:

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (->> (rx/from-coll [1 1 1 1 2 3])
                 (rx/skip-while odd?)))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: 2
;; ==> on-value: 3
;; ==> on-end
----

Or skip until another observable yields a value with `skip-until` (no example at
this moment).


=== Take

You can also limit the observable sequence to an specified number of elements:

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (->> (rx/from-coll [1 1 1 1 2 3])
                 (rx/take 2)))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: 1
;; ==> on-value: 1
;; ==> on-end
----

Or a predicate evaluates to `true`:

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (->> (rx/from-coll [1 1 1 1 2 3])
                 (rx/take-while odd?)))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: 1
;; ==> on-value: 1
;; ==> on-value: 1
;; ==> on-value: 1
;; ==> on-end
----


=== Slice

This is a combination of `skip` and `take`, and returns an observable
sequence, that represents the portion between start and end of the source
observable sequence.

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (->> (rx/from-coll [1 2 3 4])
                 (rx/slice 1 3)))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: 2
;; ==> on-value: 3
;; ==> on-end
----


=== Reduce

Allows combining all results of an observable sequence using a combining function
(also called *reducing* function):

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (->> (rx/from-coll [1 2 3 4])
                 (rx/reduce + 0)))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: 10
;; ==> on-end
----

=== Scan

Like `reduce` (see above), but returns a stream of each intermediate result
instead (similar to `reductions` in Clojure):

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (->> (rx/from-coll [1 2 3 4])
                 (rx/scan + 0)))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: 1
;; ==> on-value: 3
;; ==> on-value: 6
;; ==> on-value: 10
;; ==> on-end
----


=== Buffer

This transformer function allows to accumulate N values in a buffer and then
emits them as one value (similar to `partition` in Clojure)

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (->> (rx/from-coll [1 2 3 4])
                 (rx/buffer 2)))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: [1 2]
;; ==> on-value: [3 4]
;; ==> on-end
----


== Combinators

=== Choice

Performs an arbitrary choice between two or more observable sequences and returns the
first value available from any provided observables.

This kind of combinator works very well with operations that can timeout:

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (rx/choice
              (rx/timeout 1000 :timeout)
              (rx/timeout 900 :value)))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: :value
;; ==> on-end
----


=== Zip

This combinator combines two observable sequences in one.

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (rx/zip
              (rx/from-coll [1 2 3])
              (rx/from-coll [2 3 4])))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: [1 2]
;; ==> on-value: [2 3]
;; ==> on-value: [3 4]
;; ==> on-end
----


=== Concat

This combinator concatenates two or more observable sequences *in order*.

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (rx/concat
              (rx/from-coll [1 2])
              (rx/from-coll [3 4])))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: 1
;; ==> on-value: 2
;; ==> on-value: 3
;; ==> on-value: 4
;; ==> on-end
----


=== Merge

This combinator merges two or more observable sequences *at random* (see
`concat` for ordered).

[source, clojure]
----
(def stream (rx/merge
              (rx/from-coll [1 2])
              (rx/from-coll [3 4])))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

;; ==> on-value: 1
;; ==> on-value: 3
;; ==> on-value: 2
;; ==> on-value: 4
;; ==> on-end
----


== Subject

This is an abstraction that combines observable sequence with the observer. So
you can push values into it and transform and subscribe to it like any other
sequence.

=== Creating a subject.

You can create a subject instance using the `subject` constructor function. 

This is an example of using `subject` for two things: push values and subscribe
to it.

[source, clojure]
----
(def subject (rx/subject))
(def stream (->> subject
                (rx/skip 1)
                (rx/map inc)
                (rx/take 2)))

(rx/subscribe stream
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

(rx/push! subject 1)
(rx/push! subject 2)
(rx/push! subject 1)
(rx/push! subject 2)

;; ==> on-value: 3
;; ==> on-value: 2
;; ==> on-end
----


=== Ending a subject

You can end a subject at any moment just by executing the `end!` function:

[source, clojure]
----
(def subject (rx/subject))

(rx/subscribe subject
              #(println "on-value:" %)
              #(println "on-error:" %)
              #(println "on-end"))

(rx/end! subject)
;; ==> on-end
----


== Developers Guide

=== Philosophy

Five most important rules:

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Readability counts.

All contributions to _beicon_ should keep these important rules in mind.
